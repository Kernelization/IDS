# Kernalization IDS

This is the official repository for the Kernalization IDS. 

The goal of the IDS is to autonomously protect the user's system against online threats. The IDS will learn from previous hacks and from the subsequent securing of the system and search places that modern, fingerprint-based IDS's cannot. 

This IDS is currently still in the planning stages. Once we work out a good, working model for the future, we will update the 
README to better represent our goals.


**TODO**

1) Assemble a team

2) Initial planning
  - What are the goals for this project?
  - What are current IDS's analyzing?
  - Where can this one be different?
  - Name?

3) Assigning roles
